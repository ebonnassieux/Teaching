We will go through definining our paths, datasets, etc; we will then show how one can first install and then deploy LINC on the data as defined here.\n",

If this is not present, you can follow the steps below to install the python requirements (assuming a Linux machine):"

    "\n",
    "In order to facilitate this tutorial, we will define a series of important environment variables. **This step is crucial** in order to deploy the pipeline on a variety of environments. You will need to define:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The absolute path of your working directory. This is where you will want the pipeline to run, where you will place its input files, and where it will place its outputs. Note that **you will need a reasonable data quota at this specific location**: under **no circumstances** should it EVER be your home directory! If in doubt, ask your friendly local sysadmin where your data storage is located on your computational architecture.\n",
    "2. The absolute path to the datasets you want to reduce. At present LINC can only reduce one observation at a time; multiple observations will need sequential LINC calls on their respective datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the examples below, I have defined the environment variables for our local compute infrastructure in Wurzburg. **If you don't change these for your use case, nothing will work**: path errors are the #1 top case of errors and bugs with LINC, so please check each of these folders and files exist with a quick ls!\n"
